    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>Gourab Dutta (Dutta, 2020: 1-3) notes that the Waterfall Model was first Process Model to be introduced. It is also referred to as a linear-sequential life cycle model. The main principle of the model is that each phase must be completed before the next phase can start.</p>
<p>This type of software development model is basically used for small projects without uncertain requirements. In the end of each phase, there is a review and it determines if the project is on the right path. The decision about continuing or discarding the project can be made. In the waterfall model software testing starts only after the development stage is completed. Model phases also do not overlap (Dutta, 2020: 1-3).</p>

  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y_A0E1ToC_I" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>Project requirements has to be very well known, clear and fixed to use this model, product definition has to be stable, without ambiguous requirements. Resources with required expertise has to be available freely and project has to be short to use the model (Dutta, 2020: 1-3).</p>
<p>Waterfall model assumes that everything is carried out and taken place perfectly as planned in the previous stage and there is no need to think about the past issues that may arise in the next phase. This model does not work smoothly if there are some issues left at the previous step. The sequential nature of model does not allow us go back and undo or redo our actions. This model is best suited when developers already have designed and developed similar software in the past and are aware of all its domains (Dutta, 2020: 1-3).</p>
<p>Turning to the stages of the Waterfall Model, the first stage is Requirement Analysis &amp; Definition. It is focused on possible requirements of the system for the development. Requirements are gathered subsequent to the end user consultation. The second phase is system and software design. Before starting to code, it is important to understand what actions are to be taken. The requirement specifications are studied in detail in this phase and the design of the system is prepared. The design specifications are the base for the implementation and unit testing model phase (Dutta, 2020: 1-3).</p>
<p><img src="/waterfall2.png" alt=" Waterfall model"></p>
<p>The next stage is implementation &amp; Unit Testing. The system is developed into small coding units. These units are later integrated in the subsequent phase. Every unit is tested for its functionality. Then the integration and system testing takes place. The modules that are divided into units are integrated into a complete system and tested for proper coordination among modules and system behaves as per the specifications. When the testing process ends, the software product is delivered to the customer (Dutta, 2020: 1-3).</p>
<p>Then the Operations &amp; Maintenance stage follows. It is a never ending phase. Once the system is running in production environment, problems come up. The issues that are related to the system are solved only after deployment of the system. The problems arise from time to time and need to be solved hence this phase is referred as maintenance (Dutta, 2020: 1-3).</p>
<p>Noting the main advantages of the model, it is important to say Waterfall model is simple and easy to understand and use, it is easy to manage due to the rigidity of the model.  Each phase of the model has specific deliverables and a review process. Phases are processed and completed one at a time and do not overlap. This model works well for smaller projects where requirements are very well understood (Dutta, 2020: 1-3).</p>
<p>Turning to the disadvantages of the waterfall model, it can be associated with high costs and efforts. The number of documents to be approved in every phase, the difficulty to make changes, the difficulty iterations take to initiate and achieve and problems that arise only in later phases confirms this belief. Consequences of these issues have been that the customers’ current needs are not addressed, resulting in implemented but unused features (Van Casteren, 2017: 2). Once an application is in the testing stage, it is very difficult to go back and change something that was not well &amp; thought out in the concept stage. No working software is produced until late during the life cycle. High amounts of risk and uncertainty. Not a good model for complex and object-oriented projects. Poor model for long and ongoing projects. Not suitable for the projects where requirements are at a moderate to high risk of changing (Dutta, 2020: 1-3).</p>
